### Paired Boxplot

To understand how important shared interests are in terms of relationship compatibility, we must investigate it amongst other attributes which include: Ambition, Funny, Attractiveness, Intelligence, and Sincerity. Each of these rating were collected after a speed dating round, rating their partner on a scale of 0-10, 0 being the lowest rating and 10 being the highest rating. Based on the paired boxplots, each of the attributes has a positive relationship with the decision made by the partner, as we would expect.


### Influence of Attributes on Match Making

Now that we understand there is a **positive relationship** between all the attributes we would like to understand how strongly these characteristics are correlated to the positive decision of the opposite sex. To generate this graph we created a "positive response" metric which is the the ratio of the number of partners who indicated they would like to meet again to the number of total matches. We plotted this against the score of each attribute as used in the previous visualization. Finally, we added a correlation coefficient (R score) to the graph to distinctly identify each the strength of each relationship between the two variables.

### Race as a Dating Factor

In the section we wanted to answer how much does race play a role in the selection of potential partners. To perform this analysis we created ratios within each race group of matches of partners of the same race to the number matches in total. This fractional metric is symmetric across the diagonal because all matches (either male or female) are grouped into the same metric. From this plot we see there is a rather **high level of affinity for African American matches** relative to all other racial counterparts within the dataset.

### Men's choice by race

Specifically, we also intended to segment the results by gender so we selected out the women from the original dataset, and plotted their preferences on a racial heatmap. In this instance, the results differ across the diagonal, because the decisions of the participant and their partner are distinct separated in this representation. Again we see, the affinity for women who are African American are still have a higher positive response rate. Additionally, we see that men of African American ethnicity are likely to give positive responses across all racial groups except for Asians relative to men of differing ethnic groups.
